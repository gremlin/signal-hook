//! A backend module for implementing the iterator like
//! [`iterator`][crate::iterator] module and the asynchronous
//! adapter crates.
//!
//! This module contains generic types which abstract over the concrete
//! IO type for the self-pipe. The motivation for having this abstraction
//! are the adapter crates for different asynchronous runtimes. The runtimes
//! provide their own wrappers for [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`]
//! which should be used as the internal self pipe. But large parts of the
//! remaining functionality doesn't depend directly onto the IO type and can
//! be reused.
//!
//! See also the [`SignalDelivery::with_pipe`] method for more information
//! about requirements the IO types have to fulfill.
//!
//! As a regular user you shouldn't need to use the types in this module.
//! Use the [`Signals`][crate::iterator::Signals] struct or one of the types
//! contained in the adapter libraries instead.
